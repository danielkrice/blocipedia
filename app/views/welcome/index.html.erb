<h1>Blocipedia</h1>
<h4>Welcome to Blocipedia! This is a project I created while learning Ruby on Rails software development at Bloc. It allows users to create, edit, and delete wikis, which can either be public or private.</h4>
<h4>You may notice that when you sign up for an account, you are initially made a standard user, which means you can only edit public wikis and private wikis which a premium user has made you a collaborator on. This is mostly for demonstration purposes. If you would like to become a premium user so you can create public and private wikis and delete wikis that you created, hit "Upgrade to Premium" in the top right corner and follow the instructions.</h4>
